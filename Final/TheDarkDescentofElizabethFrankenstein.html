    <p id="sum"> Elizabeth Lavenza hasn't had a proper meal in weeks. Her thin arms are covered with bruises from her "caregiver," and she is on the verge of being thrown into the streets . . . until she is brought to the home of Victor Frankenstein, an unsmiling, solitary boy who has everything--except a friend.

Victor is her escape from misery. Elizabeth does everything she can to make herself indispensable--and it works. She is taken in by the Frankenstein family and rewarded with a warm bed, delicious food, and dresses of the finest silk. Soon she and Victor are inseparable.

But her new life comes at a price. As the years pass, Elizabeth's survival depends on managing Victor's dangerous temper and entertaining his every whim, no matter how depraved. Behind her blue eyes and sweet smile lies the calculating heart of a girl determined to stay alive no matter the cost . . . as the world she knows is consumed by darkness. </p>

<!--<img src="images/text.png" alt="Review">-->
 <p id="review"> Review : <p> Another different take on a classic, Frankenstein. This story is from the persepctive of Elizabeth, who in the classic was Frankenstein's betrothed. In the original story she was depicted as an angel, a pure loving creature who wholeheartly loved Frankenstein. In this version we get to see the unhealthy relation that is between and Elizabeth and Frankenstein. I liked the fact that we get to see another perspective of a classic story and the fact that it gives Elizabeth a lot more depth. We get to see her as a person and just some pretty face.</p>
