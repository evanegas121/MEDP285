    <p id="sum">Sarah O’Brien is alive because of the pact she and her brother made twelve years ago — James will protect her from their violent father if she promises to never leave him. For years, she’s watched James destroy his life to save hers. If all he asks for in return is her affection, she’ll give it freely.

  <p>Until, with a tiny kiss and a broken mind, he asks for more than she can give.<p>

Sam Donavon has been James’ best friend — and the boy Sarah’s had a crush on — for as long as she can remember. As their forbidden relationship deepens, Sarah knows she’s in trouble. Quiet, serious Sam has decided he’s going to save her. Neither of them realizes James is far more unstable than her father ever was, or that he’s not about to let Sarah forget her half of the pact... </p>

 <p id="review"> Review : <p>Warning to those who read it that this book shows some unsavory topics. I think this whole book was very emotional but at the same time I found it hard to connect with the characters. As emotional as the plot was, the story didn't give our characters much depth. With such a heavy topic and emotional storyline I hoped that the characters would be more than just cookie cutter personalities. Sarah was bit too Mary Sue for me. Sam didn't seem like a person at all and just seemed to be there as device plot for Sarah's reason of rebellion against her brother. I did appreciate the ending though and while it left me a little unsatisfied I think that it what was needed.</p></p>
