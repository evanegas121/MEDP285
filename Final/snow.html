"ONCE UPON A TIME" IS TIMELESS </p>

<p>The Duchess Jessica's childhood began with a tragedy: her mother's death. Her father, heartbroken at the loss of his beloved wife, could not bear to raise the child. Largely ignored, Jessica spent the first eleven years of her life running free on the family estate, cared for only by the servants. 

Then her father decides to remarry, bringing an end to Jessica's independence. At first her new stepmother just seems overly strict. But as Jessica grows into a beautiful young woman, it becomes clear that her stepmother is also wildly -- and murderously -- jealous of her. 

Jessica escapes to London. Going by the name Snow to hide from her family, she falls in love with an odd band of outcasts who accept her into their makeshift family. But when her stepmother appears in the city, repentant and seeking her forgiveness, Jessica will have to decide whom to trust...with her life.</p>

 <p id="review"> Review : <p>Set in Victorian times Snow White or Jessica is is a daughter of a Duke whose step mother is having some not so nice plans for her.  One of my favorite books to read in high school. Another retelling of Snow white but in a very original way. I really love the connections that Snow White or Jessica makes in the story. While I think some parts of the story may seem a little bizzare I'm all here for it. Definitely not super romantic as some people may want but I appreciate the relationships she has. Definitely a fun read.</p>
