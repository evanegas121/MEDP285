    <p id="sum"> When a beautiful aspiring writer strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he does what anyone would do: he Googles the name on her credit card.

There is only one Guinevere Beck in New York City. She has a public Facebook account and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and she’ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonight—the perfect place for a “chance” meeting.

As Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beck’s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beck’s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their way—even if it means murder.

A terrifying exploration of how vulnerable we all are to stalking and manipulation, debut author Caroline Kepnes delivers a razor-sharp novel for our hyper-connected digital age. </p>

 <p id="review"> Review : <p> I think a lot of people have heard of this book from the tv series. This is one of the books in which we know that our narrator , Joe, is "a bit" crazy but he himself see himself as a normal everyday Joe. I think it was a fun read to pass the time but not really worth all the hype when it comes down to the writing. I did not find it super engaging and found myself a bit bored of his rationalizng.  It does come off a little bit gimmicky but I didn't hate it. Anyway was really great depiction of a crazy guy thinking he's sane while still being able to function in society.</p>
